#Desires to learn the brick
William:
	Switch powerup abilities at will
Freeposter:
	chose tenma first, knew pippa and tenma
	doesn't know to click to shoot
	figured out to shoot after reload screen
	desire to get into locked door
	- I feel like we need more hearts
	doesn't know the heart is there
	knows to destroy the generator
	likes the shotgun
	retry 3
	- C : give full hearts on pick up power up
	figured out how to use the charge cannon immediately
	wants charge cannon to use relative charge for ammo
	suggest putting character theme on power up
	shoot enemies while they spawn

Dave:
	Select is not clear
	what is she flinging - tenma
	knew to drop down
	R to reload confused on brick
	caught the reference
	clicked off screen
	didn't notice the powerup
	using the knockback
	likes the pipcannon reload
